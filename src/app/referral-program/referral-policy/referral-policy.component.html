This Site is operated by CONSTAL and has been created to provide information about our CONSTAL and our platform designed to find developers and connect developers to those in need of development services (the “Services”) to our users (“you”, “your”). This Privacy Policy sets forth CONSTAL’s policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”), and other information that is collected from Site visitors and users of the Services.
                                                    </p>

                                                    <h6 class="h6-hding"><b> 3. Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site:</b></h6>
                                                    <p>We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information such as when you register for access to the Services (for example, your name and mailing address), use certain Services, contact us with inquiries or respond to one of our surveys. Wherever CONSTAL collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.</p>
                                                    <p>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. CONSTAL may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by CONSTAL affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, CONSTAL often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. CONSTAL may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does not identify you personally. CONSTAL may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>
                                                    <p>In operating this Site, we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features.</p>

If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided.

Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. For example, if you are a developer, we will use certain of your Personal Data to create a public profile within the Services; this profile is searchable and may be viewed by users seeking developers. CONSTAL and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our users and to improve the Services. CONSTAL and its Related Companies may use this information to communicate with you regarding the Services or to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. Note however that as user of the Service you cannot opt-out of some administrative communications that are reasonably necessary to the Service, such as billing or service notifications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.</p>
