Program Overview:</strong> You are not obligated to, but you may, at your discretion, provide CONSTAL with referrals (as defined in Section 6.2 below) for Qualified Prospects (defined in Section 6.2, below).

                                                    <p><strong>6.3. Method of Referral: </strong> During all periods in which you are eligible as a Participant, you may provide CONSTAL with referrals through the following methods: (a) you provide CONSTAL with the Contact Information (defined in Section 6.4, below) of a Qualified Prospect by emailing all such Contact Information to a CONSTAL authorized-representative; (b) you invite the Qualified Prospect to contact CONSTAL as a prospective CONSTAL Client, Talent, or Talent Supplier of CONSTAL by providing them with access to the unique website link that CONSTAL may make available to you for such purposes (“Referral Link”); and (c) you encourage a Qualified Prospect to contact CONSTAL as a prospective CONSTAL Client, Talent, or Talent Supplier of CONSTAL and when that person contacts us they inform us that you provided the referral to us.</p>
                                                    <p><strong>6.4. Contact Information: </strong> Any Contact Information that you provide CONSTAL must include: (1) if for an individual, that person’s first and last name and direct phone number and work-related email address, and (2) if for a business or other entity, the business’s or entity’s name, the first and last name of a relevant employee of that business or entity and their direct phone number and work-related email address. All Contact Information must be complete and accurate and obtained by you lawfully and with all necessary permissions and consents.</p>
                                                    <p><strong>6.5. Qualified Referral: </strong> CONSTAL will only pay Referral Fees with respect to Qualified Referrals. A “Qualified Referral” is a referral that is: (1) made to a Qualified Prospect, (2) provided to CONSTAL or the Qualified Prospect by you (and, except for a Posted Referral, not by or through any other person or entity), (3) except for a Posted Referral, provided directly to or generated from your direct communications with the Qualified Prospect alone, (4) not part of any spam or other referral, offer, or solicitation of any type, (5) fully compliant with the Additional Referral and Posted Referral Content Requirements set out in Schedule B, and (6) in all respects, made in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and otherwise in full compliance with this TOS. Further, to be eligible as a Qualified Referral, the referral must also: (a) with respect to referrals of Talent or Talent Suppliers to CONSTAL, result in the prospective Talent or Talent Supplier (as applicable) applying to CONSTAL (if you provide the referral through the use of a Referral Link, such Talent or Talent Supplier application must be received by CONSTAL within thirty (30) days of the prospective Talent or Talent Supplier first visiting the Site via the Referral Link) and subsequently become accepted as a Talent or Talent Supplier (as applicable) in the Network); and (b) with respect to Clients, result in the prospective Client applying to CONSTAL (if you provide the referral through the use of a Referral Link, such Client application must be received by CONSTAL within thirty (30) days of the prospective Talent or Talent Supplier first visiting the Site via the Referral Link). Moreover, to be a Qualified Referral, a prospective Client, Talent, or Talent Supplier referred to CONSTAL must complete a fully-paid engagement with CONSTAL within six (6) months of CONSTAL’s receipt of the referral (in the case of a Referral Link referral, six (6) months from the day the prospect first visits CONSTAL’s Site via the Referral Link) and CONSTAL must be fully and timely paid for such engagement. Nothing in this TOS obligates you to provide CONSTAL with referrals or CONSTAL to consider, contact, cooperate with, evaluate, approve, accept, engage or enter any agreement or other arrangement with any prospective or existing Talent, Talent Supplier, or Client.</p>
                                                    <p><strong>6.6 Additional Referral Limitations: </strong> Referrals made pursuant to Section 6.3(a) (i.e., by email) or 6.3(c) (i.e., personal introduction) must be made to people whom you know and have a good working relationship. Referrals made via the Referral Link may be effected (a) by direct correspondence (e.g., via email or text) initiated by you, in which case such Referrals must also comply with the provisions applicable to email referrals under Section 6.3(a), or (b) by posting the Referral Link on a blog or other web property that is owned or controlled by you or included as part of content (“Posted Referral Content”) that you alone created and post to another website or online forum (a “Posted Referral”). Posted Referral Content must comply with all provisions of this TOS, including, without limitation, the additional requirements set out on Schedule B hereto. If requested by CONSTAL, you will promptly provide CONSTAL with links to all instances of your public use of any Referral Link(s) and you will, upon CONSTAL’s request, immediately, permanently remove or delete any such links. Except as expressly permitted for a Posting Referral, you must not use public postings or other multi-party communications to generate or provide referrals, including without limitation, advertising, posting on public or group forums, third party websites, social networks, and the like. If you are an employee of any government entity or agency, referrals by you (directly or indirectly) to your employer or any government agency or entity with which you have any influence regarding vendor selection or contract matters are prohibited under this TOS. Any referral generated or provided through any such prohibited means or otherwise not in compliance with this TOS will not be a Qualified Referral. Additionally, because of the informal nature of referrals provided under Section 6.3(c) (whereby you have the prospect contact CONSTAL and tell us that you referred them to us) it may be difficult or impossible for us to attribute the referral to you. For instance, the prospect may neglect to inform us that you provided the referral, or they may provide us with inaccurate or incomplete information about you. In any such events, the referral will not be deemed a Qualified Referral unless we receive all necessary information to attribute it to you within 30 days of the initial referral.</p>
                                                    <p><strong>6.7. Referral Fees for Talent and Talent Supplier Referrals: </strong> Subject to adjustment, as set forth in this TOS, CONSTAL’s current (as of the date of this TOS) referral fees (collectively “Referral Fees”) under this TOS consist of: (1) a fee for a Qualified Referral to a Talent or Talent Supplier (“Talent Referral Fee”); and (2) a fee for a Qualified Referral to a Client (“Client Referral Fee”) which results in a new Client for CONSTAL. The current amounts (as of the date of this TOS) of the Referral Fees are set out in Schedule A. The Referral Fees may be changed by CONSTAL in Schedule A and/or on CONSTAL’s website at any time, without notice. The most current, published Referral Fees will apply at the time that any Referral Fee accrues. A Talent Referral Fee will accrue when the applicable Talent (or personnel of Talent Supplier) completes his/her first successful trial with a Client and such Client pays CONSTAL all amounts for such trial. A Client Referral Fee accrues after the Client approves its first trial of any Talent provided by CONSTAL and pays CONSTAL all amounts for such trial (and no conditions, waivers, or contingencies applicable to such payment are in effect). CONSTAL will pay you the accrued Referral Fees that you earned within 30 days from the end of the month in which such fees accrued. Without limitation, CONSTAL will have no obligation to pay any Referral Fees that have not accrued under this Section 6.7 or that otherwise arise from or relate to any violation of this TOS. Further, with respect to a Client Referral Fee, if the net amount actually received by CONSTAL for the relevant referral (less amounts paid to relevant Talent and reimbursed expenses) for the first paid engagement with such Client is less than the applicable Client Referral Fee, the Client Referral Fee will be reduced to 50% of such net amount actually received by CONSTAL. All amounts will be paid in U.S. dollars and CONSTAL will have no risk or liability with respect to monetary conversion fees and exchange rates that may be applied by financial institutions involved in payment processing and transfer.</p>
                                                    <p><strong>6.8. Use of Your Information: </strong> You agree that CONSTAL may use (and disclose to others as necessary) all information that you provide to us with respect to any referral, including your name and contact information and any Client or Talent information to: (a) confirm any referral that you have provided, (b) determine your compliance with this TOS and to enforce the same, (c) comply with law and any government or court order, demand, or action, and (c) otherwise operate the Program and all associated systems and operations.</p>
                                                    <p><strong>6.9. No Duplicate Payments: </strong> CONSTAL may, in its sole discretion, offer other referral or incentive programs by which it compensates individuals and/or entities for referrals, incentives, introductions, or the like. In the event that you participate in any other such referral, introduction, or incentive program, CONSTAL will, regardless of any conflicting provisions in this TOS or the applicable terms and conditions for any other such program or offering, only pay you a single fee for a referral, introduction, or the like to any particular individual or entity. CONSTAL will determine, in its sole discretion, which fee(s) potentially apply and will pay you (and have no obligation to pay any amounts other than) the highest single fee applicable to the relevant referral, incentive, introduction or the like.</p>
